/**
 * @file PlayerSessionCallback.ts
 * @description This module exposes mandatory / optional interfaces needs to be implemented by apps based on the following type of application.
 * DMP App  - Default Media Player Application
 *          - Applications which uses Video player provided by Kepler API
 *          - Ex: "@amazon-devices/react-native-kepler/Libraries/VideoPlayer";
 *          - DMP apps get basic voice experience such as play / pause / seekTo / stop / start over / fast forward / rewind by default with out
 *
 * CMP App  - Custom Media Player Application
 *          - Applications which provide their own media player pipeline
 *          - CMP apps have to implement the required interfaces from this module to voice experience. No default voice experience is provided
 *
 * EMP App  - External Media Player Application
 * *        - Applications which provide their own media player pipeline and manage their own playback queues
 *          - EMP apps need to support additional interfaces as marked in this module
 *
 * The future versions of this module / API will attempt to be in sync with @link {https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/device-apis/list-of-interfaces.html}
 *
 * @todo Need to improve API to mandate responses to call backs using promises. This is needed to send success / failure responses to middleware and in turn to Alexa
 *
 * @todo In future, this API needs to support other platforms as well such as FOS / Android etc as kepler API needs to support multi platforms
 *
 * @todo Check if @link {@function onCustomDataUpdate} function needs to be exposed to apps for additional information

/**
 * The MediaId type is designed for the purpose of uniquely identifying media
 * content within a catalog system.
 *
 * It encapsulates two critical pieces of information: the identifier and the
 * name of the catalog to which the media belongs.
 * For example:
 *  contentId = "tt0050083", catalogName = "imdb" identifies a title from the
 *  imdb database

     * A string representing the name of the catalog where the media is stored.

     * This property provides context to the contentId, specifying which catalog
     * or library the `contentId` refers to. This is particularly useful in systems
     * that interact with multiple media catalogs, as it helps prevent confusion
     * between identically named media in different catalogs.
     *
     * Use reverse dns name notation when possible to identify the catalog name.
     * For example, if you catalog provider is hosted by a service named
     * `com.provider.some.service`, then use `com.provider.some.service` for the
     * catalog name.
     *
     * If the media streaming app, streams content from its own catalog, the
     * catalog name should be the package id of the application, say for example,
     * `com.somevendor.mystreamingserviceplus`

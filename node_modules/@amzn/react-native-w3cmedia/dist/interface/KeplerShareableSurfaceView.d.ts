 * @brief This is a react native component that Renders video frames on the screen.
 * Use this component only when operating in pre-buffering mode using the `VideoPlayer`
 * component, where more than one player can be pre-buffered simultaneously with
 * different contents. The app then attaches the surface handle passed by the
 * `onSurfaceViewCreated` event callback to the video player instance that needs
 * to be rendered.

 * @remarks This is a typescript class and not a react native component. Apps need
 * to create an instance of `VideoPlayer` and use it to start buffering the content
 * without rendering video on screen. It doesn't render video to the screen by
 *  default, nor does it render the media controls GUI. Apps are expected to build
 * their own media controls UI and control the playback experience. When the app
 * wants to show the video on screen, it must add `KeplerVideoSurfaceView` React
 * Native component to the render tree, receive `onSurfaceViewCreated` event and
 * pass the surface handle obtained in the event callback to `VideoPlayer` through
 * the `setSurfaceHandle` API.
